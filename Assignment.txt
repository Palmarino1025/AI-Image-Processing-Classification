1: Image is going to be of a Blue Macaw

2: The explaination makes sense for each line of code and what it does 

Top-3 Predictions:
1: macaw (0.89)
2: toucan (0.01)
3: African_grey (0.00)

3: I had to install the Opencv import which had a conflict with the version of Numpy 
    -I updated the requirements.txt for the version 
    -I also needed to use Python3.11 instead of 3.12 for the install of Opencv
    -it looks to be focusing on the center of the parrots neck in its heatmap

4: the suggested occlude or masks for the pictures are 
    Black Box / Solid Color Block:
        Draw a rectangle (or another shape) with a solid color (like black) over the region you want to occlude.
    Blurring:
        Apply a blur (e.g., Gaussian blur) to a selected area. This obscures details while keeping the overall context.
    Pixelation:
        Reduce the resolution of a specific region by resizing it to a smaller dimension and then scaling it back up, resulting in a mosaic or pixelated effect.

    for this i had to get the computer to first generate the photos correctly over the heatmap and then once i get the right photos i had it then run its classication

5: The suggested explaination worked and I did understand it quite easily

    the 3 suggested filters are Edge detection, sharpening and Embossing
    my creative filter is going to be giving the parrot a nice smile
